# Paralegal Article Database
This project came about to solve the problem of paralegals wasting time looking for often used articles in case submissions. The law firm was small and had very little systems in place. 
This application stores links to the commonly used articles organized by country. This allows the paralegals to quickly find the article they need to add to a court submission. Previously the paralegals would search for old cases they knew were similar and then search through court documents that were 100s of pages long looking for articles they had used as supplimentary evidence.
